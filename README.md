# Adaptive CBF-RRT* 
This ripo is for the implementation of the a sampling-based motion planning algorithm, in which we utilize control barrier function as a low level local planner for RRT*. Furthermore, we equip the algorithm with adaptive sampling procedure to enhance the sampling in the configuration space. For details refer to [the arxiv paper].
